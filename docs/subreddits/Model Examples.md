    "selftext":"**If you are a tiefling bard who never leaves home without four changes of clothing and Alter Self, please stop reading this.**\n\nSo I just ran the 3rd session of my current 5e campaign, and it went incredibly well. In a particularly clutch moment, our (incognito) Tiefling Bard saved the day by using Unseen Servant to distract a river troll long enough for a group of three 5th level adventurers to sneak past, activate a mechanism to lower a water wheel into the river, and restore back up power to a nearby facility. When the troll returned, she used Friends and Nat 20'd a persuasion check that involved rations, soothing voices, and gestures of submission. They were still in the troll's dwelling, though, so rather than attack them it merely knocked them out a window and into the river.\n\nLater on when they arrived at the facility, the party faced a group of skeletons in an alchemist lab that lobbed vials of various substances at them. After a few explosive rounds of combat, the bard cast Enthrall on the skeletons, endured the brunt of their attacks until the next round, and cast a minor illusion of herself directly in front of her before hiding in the shadows. I love out of the box thinking, and that was so good that for a full round the skeletons wasted their ammunition on the duplicate.\n\nAnd then the Minotaur Paladin walked directly under a black pudding without healing up after combat. It became a race to kill the pudding before it killed the Paladin. This was one of the relatively few cases in my campaign where clever tricks could not work. This is also when I found out that the only attack spell the Bard has is vicious mockery. She wanted to use mage hand or unseen servant to pull the minotaur out before learning of the weight limit each could move. She ended up using mage hand to deliver alchemical fire to a part of the ooze that wasn't currently engulfing the paladin.\n\nAll of this is a precursor to my question. Within this dungeon is a treasure hoard, and I know exactly what kind of equipment would benefit each of my players, with the exception of the bard. For background, she is a College of Glamour bard who dropped out of bard college. The only instrument she is proficient in is a pair of stone turntables that pulls music from the ether. I don't know if I should play to her strengths with more utility and jack-of-all-trades style items, or try to get some items into her hands that would help in the inevitable fights that are certain to crop up.\n\nI use a mix of core and homebrew, so any suggestions at all are welcome. The player is coming from a decent 3.5 background and is styling the character after the old beguiler if that helps at all.",

    "body":"I think they want to keep the players from resting to make the dungeons more difficult or feel like they're actually in a dangerous place. \n\nBut your question brings up excellent points. Resting, even in a monster filled dungeon can bring it's own fun, whether raided in the night or finding ways for the party to prevent being raided, to other interesting encounters. Perhaps the monsters are smart enough to do something like trap them in a room and poor poisonous smoke or some other trap.",
